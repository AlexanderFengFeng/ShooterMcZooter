### Simple third-person shooter prototype

Written in C++ (with some Blueprint) using Unreal Engine 5. Codebase built entirely from scratch (not using code from Unreal Engine's third-person game template) using Unreal's built-in libraries.

### Game modes
- Time rush: Clear the level as fast as possible.
- Survival: Kill as many enemies without dying.

### Technical implementations
- Basic third-person movement and gameplay
- Animation blending and state machines
- Enemy AI implemented with a behavior tree and blackboard
- Looping spawning
- Multiple game modes and UI widgets
- End scenarios
- OOP via the implementation of parent/child classes
